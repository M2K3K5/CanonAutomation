This c# wpf project automates regular processes that I perform with my connected camera. 

When the camera is connected to the computer, the program detects this and automatically copies all photos and 
videos to the correct folder on the hard drive. The files are sorted or copied to the correct subfolder by file extension. 
In addition, the photo folder is opened in Windows Explorer and an Adobe Photo Converter is started.

The wpf window starts hidden and is displayed in the system tray as a small icon.
Using the system tray menu, the program can be closed permanently or the window can be shown.
